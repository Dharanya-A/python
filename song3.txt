Someone You loved 
I'm going under and I fear this time there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down
And you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down
And you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down
And you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
